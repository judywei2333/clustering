# Clustering MD frames

Given thousands of MD snapshots, how do we divide them into clusters and pick representative snapshots for each cluster?

From the clustering, we need to know:
 
 * the centroids
 * weight


## Clustering at a glance


## Multi-dimensional clustering
Defining distance

### Distance based on RMSD of aligned structures

### Distance based on Structure signature

### Comparing two distance measurement

### Clustering frames based on distance

## One dimensional clustering
Pros:
* Fast
* Intuitive
* Can visually identify number of clusters

Cons:
* Use partial information
* Less accurate, may miss-place elements


### Find a numerical value to represent a structure

### Clustering in one dimension

### Enhance the accuracy by dual clustering

## Compare all results

### Accuracy

### Efficiency
